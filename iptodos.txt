more metadata accessible within block during runtime - `self.metadata['n_datums']` etc
maybe a batch block is returning an array or list of arrays?
shape checking - did you mean (None,)?


check to make sure all update args are blocks - throw an error if otherwise'

make this better:
imagepypelines.core.Exceptions.BlockError: invalid type for 'sources'. must be <class 'astropy.table.table.Table'>, not <class 'NoneType'>. (you can disable this check with the 'skip_enforcement' keyword)


constants in pipeline


don't enforce parity on batch_type = all blocks



more explict block argument errors


better error message when a user misspells the name of a variable - instead of just "KeyError"

name variable name there is an invalid container type.


data inspection tool!


"Type Incompatibility?" messages


print what block will be computed next

makes sure there no key error for block inputs
